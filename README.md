A beautiful little game called Rock Paper Scissors
Made with the core concepts of javascript and a little spiced up using CSS styling.

Through this project I learnt about:
1. LocalStorage : How we can store the developments and republish when the page is refreshed.
2. Fucntions : How the code can be reused extensively in such projects.
3. Document Object Model (DOM) : Helps in combining HTML and Javascript together.
